# README: Wine Type Prediction using K-means Clustering

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of K-means clustering algorithm to predict the type of wine based on its attributes. The dataset used contains various chemical properties of wines.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the 'Wine' dataset, which we created by combiining two data sets of red and white wine into one single data set called wine. It includes 13 attributes (such as alcohol content, malic acid concentration, etc.) and a class label specifying the type of wine.

## Requirements
- R programming environment (version 3.5 or later)
- Necessary R packages:
  - `ggplot2` for data visualization
  - `cluster` for performing K-means clustering

## Installation
Ensure you have R installed. You can install required packages using the following commands in R console:
```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("cluster")

for more packages involved please check the pdf file which is just RMarkdown file converted to pdf to better understand and know what is going on.
```

## Conclusion
K-means clustering is a useful technique for exploring and analyzing datasets like the Wine dataset. It helps in identifying natural groupings or clusters within the data based on the specified attributes. This README provides a basic outline for using K-means clustering in R to predict the type of wine based on its chemical properties.
