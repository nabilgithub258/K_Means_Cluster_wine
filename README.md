This project uses K-Means clustering to classify wines into two categories: red and white. The dataset contains various chemical properties of the wines, and the clustering algorithm groups them based on these properties. This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning techniques in wine classification.
Although for the project we had a column to compare our model to, but usually these models are what we call unsupervised learning models meaning there is nothing to compare or to predict but they are clustering based on the different attributes. This is where the domain knowledge comes into play.
